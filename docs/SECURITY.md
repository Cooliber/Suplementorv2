# Security Policy

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures and compliance standards implemented in the Suplementor application to protect user data, ensure medical information accuracy, and maintain GDPR compliance.

## Security Architecture

### Data Protection Strategy

#### Encryption at Rest
- **Database Encryption**: All sensitive data encrypted using AES-256
- **Backup Encryption**: All database backups encrypted before storage
- **File System Encryption**: Medical data files encrypted on disk

#### Encryption in Transit
- **TLS 1.3**: All communications encrypted with TLS 1.3
- **Certificate Pinning**: Prevents man-in-the-middle attacks
- **HSTS**: Strict Transport Security enforced

#### Access Control
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Users have minimal required permissions
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Required for admin accounts
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with automatic timeout

### Medical Data Security

#### Patient Data Protection
```typescript
// Medical data classification and handling
enum DataSensitivity {
  PUBLIC = 'public',
  INTERNAL = 'internal',
  CONFIDENTIAL = 'confidential',
  MEDICAL = 'medical'
}

interface MedicalData {
  sensitivity: DataSensitivity;
  encryption: boolean;
  retention: number; // days
  accessLog: boolean;
}
```

#### Data Anonymization
- Personal identifiers removed from research data
- Statistical analysis performed on anonymized datasets
- No clear-text medical data in logs

  timestamp: Date;
  ipAddress: string;
  userAgent: string;
  version: string; // Privacy policy version
}

const manageGDPRConsent = async (consent: GDPRConsent) => {
  // Store consent with full audit trail
  await db.gdprConsent.create({
    data: {
      ...consent,
      expiresAt: new Date(Date.now() + 365 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000) // 1 year
    }
  });
};
```
