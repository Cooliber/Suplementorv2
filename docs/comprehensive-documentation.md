## Core Features

### Knowledge Graph Visualization
The graph system allows users to explore relationships between:
- Supplements and their mechanisms of action
- Neurotransmitters and brain regions
- Cognitive functions and supporting compounds
- Research evidence and claims

### Psychology and Cognitive Tools
- **Cognitive Bias Detector**: Identifies and mitigates common biases in supplement evaluation
- **Habit Formation Tracker**: Helps users build consistent supplement routines using behavioral psychology
- **Productivity Technique Browser**: Evidence-based productivity techniques with supplement synergies

### Supplement Management
- **Comprehensive Supplement Cards**: Detailed information about each supplement
- **Dosage Calculator**: Personalized dosage recommendations
- **Interaction Matrix**: Check for potential supplement interactions
- **Safety Checker**: Identify contraindications and safety concerns

### Educational Content
- **Learning Paths**: Structured educational modules
- **Neurotransmitter Education**: In-depth information about brain chemistry
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor educational progress

## Implementation Examples

### Comprehensive Dashboard
The example dashboard demonstrates how to integrate all components into a cohesive user experience:
- Real-time supplement tracking
- Knowledge graph visualization
- Habit formation tracking
- Productivity technique implementation
- Cognitive bias mitigation
- Educational modules

### Data Flow
```
User Input → Store State → Component Rendering → Visualization → User Feedback
```

### State Management
- **Zustand**: For global state management (knowledge graph, user preferences)
- **React Context**: For component-specific state
- **Props**: For passing data between components

## Polish Localization

All components include:
- Complete Polish translation of UI elements
- Culturally appropriate examples and scenarios
- Proper accessibility support for Polish users
- Localized scientific terminology

## Accessibility

All components follow WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines:
- Screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard navigation
- Proper color contrast ratios
- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA attributes

## Performance Optimization

### Rendering Efficiency
- Virtualized lists for large datasets
- Memoization for expensive calculations
- Lazy loading for content
- Efficient re-rendering strategies

### Data Handling
- Progressive loading for large datasets
- Caching strategies
- Optimized API calls
- Efficient data structures

## Best Practices

### Component Design
1. **Single Responsibility**: Each component has a clear, focused purpose
2. **Composability**: Components can be easily combined and reused
3. **Accessibility First**: Accessibility is built into every component
4. **Internationalization Ready**: Text is separated for easy translation
5. **Performance Conscious**: Efficient rendering and minimal bundle size

### Data Patterns
1. **Immutable Updates**: State updates don't modify existing objects
2. **Consistent Structure**: Data follows consistent schemas across components
3. **Validation**: Data is validated using Zod schemas
4. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with user-friendly messages

### UI/UX Principles
1. **Consistency**: Consistent design language across all components
2. **Feedback**: Immediate feedback for all user actions
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Complex information revealed gradually
4. **Contextual Help**: Help information available when needed
