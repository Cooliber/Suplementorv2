# Supplement-Drug Interaction Analysis Prompt

## Context
Comprehensive analysis of supplement-drug interactions for safety assessment in the Suplementor platform, focusing on Polish healthcare context.

## Prompt
```
Analyze supplement-drug interactions with focus on safety and clinical relevance:

1. **Interaction Classification System**
   - Synergistic interactions (beneficial combinations)
   - Antagonistic interactions (reduced effectiveness)
   - Additive interactions (enhanced effects)
   - Competitive interactions (absorption interference)
   - Polish terminology for interaction types

2. **High-Priority Drug Classes**
   - Anticoagulants (warfarin, heparin) with Omega-3
   - Antihypertensives with Magnesium
   - Sedatives with L-Theanine and Ashwagandha
   - Immunosuppressants with Ashwagandha
   - Antibiotics with Magnesium and B-Complex

3. **Mechanism-Based Analysis**
   - Cytochrome P450 enzyme interactions
   - Absorption competition mechanisms
   - Protein binding displacement
   - Renal clearance modifications
   - Pharmacodynamic interactions

4. **Severity Assessment Framework**
   - Severe: Life-threatening or requiring immediate intervention
   - Moderate: Clinically significant, monitoring required
   - Minor: Minimal clinical impact
   - Beneficial: Positive therapeutic outcomes
   - Polish risk communication strategies

5. **Specific Supplement Profiles**
   - Alpha-GPC: Anticholinergic medication interactions
   - Caffeine: Stimulant and cardiovascular drug interactions
   - Magnesium: Antibiotic and bisphosphonate interactions
   - Ashwagandha: Autoimmune medication contraindications
   - Omega-3: Bleeding risk with anticoagulants

6. **Clinical Monitoring Requirements**
   - Laboratory parameter monitoring (INR, blood pressure)
   - Symptom assessment protocols
   - Dosage adjustment guidelines
   - Timing modification strategies
   - Healthcare provider communication

7. **Polish Healthcare Integration**
   - NFZ (National Health Fund) medication databases
   - Polish prescribing patterns
   - Cultural supplement use practices
   - Healthcare provider education needs
   - Patient counseling approaches

8. **Risk Mitigation Strategies**
   - Temporal separation protocols
   - Dosage modification guidelines
   - Alternative supplement recommendations
   - Monitoring frequency adjustments
   - Emergency response procedures

9. **Educational Content Development**
   - Interaction mechanism visualizations
   - Risk assessment tools
   - Patient education materials
   - Healthcare provider resources
   - Polish language safety warnings

10. **Evidence-Based Assessment**
    - Clinical case reports analysis
    - Pharmacokinetic study data
    - Real-world evidence synthesis
    - Regulatory agency warnings
    - Quality of evidence evaluation

11. **Technology Integration**
    - Interaction checking algorithms
    - Alert system specifications
    - User interface design for warnings
    - Database integration requirements
    - Mobile app safety features
