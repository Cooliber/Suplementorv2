# Evidence Quality Assessment Framework Prompt

## Context
Development of comprehensive evidence quality assessment framework for supplement research in the Suplementor platform, ensuring scientific rigor and Polish educational standards.

## Prompt
```
Develop evidence quality assessment framework for supplement research:

1. **Study Design Hierarchy**
   - Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PrzeglÄ…dy systematyczne i metaanalizy)
     * Cochrane review standards
     * PRISMA reporting guidelines
     * Heterogeneity assessment
     * Publication bias evaluation
   
   - Randomized Controlled Trials (Randomizowane badania kontrolowane)
     * Double-blind placebo-controlled design
     * Sample size adequacy
     * Randomization quality
     * Blinding effectiveness assessment
   
   - Observational Studies (Badania obserwacyjne)
     * Cohort study quality indicators
     * Case-control study limitations
     * Cross-sectional study applications
     * Confounding factor control

2. **Quality Assessment Tools**
   - Jadad Scale for RCT quality (0-10 scoring)
   - GRADE system for evidence certainty
   - Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for observational studies
   - AMSTAR-2 for systematic review quality
   - Polish adaptation considerations

3. **Supplement-Specific Evidence Evaluation**
   - Alpha-GPC: Ziegenfuss 2008 study (Quality Score: 8.5)
     * Small sample size limitations (n=7)
     * Short duration concerns
     * Outcome measure relevance
     * Replication needs
   
   - L-Theanine: Kimura 2007 stress study (Quality Score: 8.0)
     * Physiological outcome validation
     * Dose-response relationship
     * Duration of effects
     * Population generalizability
   
   - Omega-3: Freeman 2010 psychiatric review (Quality Score: 9.0)
     * Comprehensive evidence synthesis
     * Clinical relevance assessment
     * Heterogeneity considerations
     * Mechanism validation

4. **Bias Assessment Framework**
   - Selection bias identification
   - Performance bias evaluation
   - Detection bias assessment
   - Attrition bias analysis
   - Reporting bias detection
   - Industry funding bias considerations

5. **Statistical Analysis Quality**
   - Power calculation adequacy
   - Statistical method appropriateness
   - Multiple comparison corrections
   - Effect size reporting
   - Confidence interval interpretation
   - P-hacking detection

6. **Clinical Relevance Assessment**
   - Outcome measure clinical significance
   - Population representativeness
   - Dose relevance to real-world use
   - Duration appropriateness
   - Safety outcome inclusion
   - Polish population applicability

7. **Evidence Synthesis Methods**
   - Quantitative meta-analysis approaches
   - Qualitative evidence synthesis
   - Network meta-analysis applications
   - Individual patient data analysis
   - Real-world evidence integration

8. **Regulatory Compliance**
   - EFSA (European Food Safety Authority) standards
   - Polish regulatory requirements
   - Health claim substantiation
   - Safety assessment protocols
   - Post-market surveillance integration

9. **Educational Content Development**
   - Evidence hierarchy visualization
   - Quality assessment tool explanations
   - Critical appraisal skill development
   - Polish scientific literacy promotion
   - Interactive assessment modules

10. **Implementation Guidelines**
    - Evidence grading protocols
    - Quality score calculation methods
    - Update frequency requirements
    - Conflict of interest disclosure
    - Transparency standards

11. **Technology Integration**
    - Automated quality assessment tools
    - Evidence database management
    - Update notification systems
    - User interface for evidence display
    - Mobile accessibility considerations

Generate comprehensive evidence quality framework with Polish educational focus and practical implementation guidelines for the Suplementor platform.
